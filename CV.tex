    What is needed for open source software projects to be efficient? Linus' Law celebrates the `many eyeballs' as a key advantage of open source projects. 
    Nevertheless, when it comes to efficiency, `many eyeballs' could be a double-bladed sword. By mining and analyzing the data collected from GitHub open source projects, this paper performed data envelopment analysis (DEA) on 34 open source projects.

    Although screen readers can convey the textual information or structural properties of a web page, they cannot deliver its overall impression. Such a limitation hinders blind web users from obtaining an overview of the website, which non-blind people can do in a short time. 
    SoundGlance is a novel application that briefly delivers an auditory summary of web pages. SoundGlance supports the screen reader users by converting the important glanceable cues of the pages into sound.
    To automatically extract the glanceable cues, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the annotations on the screenshots of 39 web pages.

  \vspace{2mm}\newline
  {\small{
    Online chat is an emerging channel for discussing community problems. It is common practice for communities to assign dedicated moderators to maintain a structured discussion and enhance the problem-solving experience. However, due to the synchronous nature of online chat, moderators face a high managerial overhead in tasks like discussion stage management, opinion summarization, and consensus-building support. SolutionChat is a system that assists moderators with facilitating a structured discussion for community problem-solving.
    With SolutionChat, we envision untrained moderators to effectively facilitate chat-based discussions of important community matters.

    Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) technologies are widely used to help non-verbal children enable communication. For AAC-aided communication to be successful, caregivers should support children with consistent intervention strategies in various settings. TalkingBoogie supports caregivers to effectively collaborate with one another and create a shared understanding of intervention strategies.
